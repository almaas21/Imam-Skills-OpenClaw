## KHUTBAH PART 1

### Opening (Khutbatul Hajah) — Always in Arabic
_[RECITE ALOUD — slowly]_

Innal-hamda lillah, nahmaduhu wa nasta'inuhu wa nastaghfiruh.  
Wa na'udhu billahi min shururi anfusina wa min sayyi'ati a'malina.  
Man yahdihil-lahu fala mudilla lah, wa man yudlil fala hadiya lah.  
Ash-hadu alla ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lah,  
wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh.

_Translation:_ "Indeed all praise is for Allah. We praise Him, seek His help, and ask His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil of our souls and our bad deeds. Whoever Allah guides, none can misguide; whoever He misguides, none can guide. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger."
